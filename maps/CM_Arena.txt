Map Description         : This map was made in dedication to my ex-HLDM clan, Colonial Marines.
			  It originally started out as a small indoors arena, but quickly expanded
			  into a medium sized deathmatch map. Even the original indoors section
			  has changed completely :)

			  w_poly readings hit 1400ish in 2 places, but they are just small spots. All
			  other areas *fingers crossed* have stayed well below 1000 :)

Other Works by Author   : [1] Obsolete
			  [2] Elixir
			  [3] Rebellion

Misc Author Info        : This is my fourth map release. I am currently 17 [at 19/04/02] and live 
			  in Scotland in a little town called North Berwick where i skateboard,
			  map and piss about on computers. Sometime i hope to gain a career in a
			  level design...nothing wrong with optimism :)
